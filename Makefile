#
# build		(default) build binaries for the current architecture,
#               including cyclecounter-enabled binaries, if supported
# clobber	remove all binaries and results for the current architecture
# clobberall	remove all binaries, and entire contents of Results directory
# setup		interactive setup for a run on the current machine
# run		run the benchmarks using the run file corresponding to
#               the hostname
# summary	produce a summary version of all stored results
