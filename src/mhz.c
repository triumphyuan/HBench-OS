 * mhz.c - calculate clock rate and megahertz

 * The sparc specific code is to get around the double-pumped ALU in the 
 * SuperSPARC that can do two adds in one clock. Apparently, only 
 * SuperSPARC does this.
 * Thanks to John Mashey (mash@sgi.com) for explaining this.
 *
 * The AIX specific code is because the C compiler on rs6000s does not 
 * respect the register directive.  "a" below is a stack variable and 
 * there are two instructions per increment instead of one.
 * Please note that this may not be correct for other AIX systems.
